/**
 * Represents a configurable multi-lateral network relationship.
 *
 * The configurability of this state allows different business networks to specify requirements for managing
 * multi-lateral working relationships whilst maintaining interoperability with other business networks using
 * the same underlying framework.
 *
 * When creating or amending a relationship state, the transaction must only contain one output, which is the
 * relationship state. This transaction needs to be propagated to all participants of the relationship as all of
 * them are required to attest to the relationship. Relationship attestation is static because any participant of
 * the relationship state can amend it. If attestations were linear, this would pose a vulnerability, as participants
 * would implicitly attest to updated relationship states which could have undesirable consequences on the network.
 *
 * The network operator is considered a participant of this state because they have authority to create, amend
 * or even revoke relationships as they see fit, however relationships are still considered invalid until attested.
 *
 * @property network The identity of the network.
 * @property configuration The configuration which determines how participants of the relationship cooperate.
 * @property previousStateRef The state ref to the previous version of the state, or null if this is this first version.
 * @property linearId The unique identifier of the state.
 * @property participants The relationship configuration network identities, and optionally the network operator.
 * @property hash A SHA-256 hash that uniquely identifies this version of the state.
